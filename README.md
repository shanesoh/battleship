battleship
==========

MATLAB implementation of the board game Battleship
Just a fun GUI-based assignment for a MATLAB class I was TA-ing for.

%n: number of cells one each side of playing field
%ships: m by 2 cell array containing m number of ships
%the first column contains the names of the ships in a string
%the second column contains the sizes of the ships
%e.g. ships= {'aircraft carrier', 5; 'battleship', 4; 'submarine', 3;
%'destroyer', 3; 'patrol boat', 2};
%the above inputs the ships and their corresponding sizes as per the
%assignment handout
